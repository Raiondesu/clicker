# clicker
A small auto-clicker app for windows that I made around 10 years ago.

Press the Command Key + Execution Key (`End` + `Home` by default) to initiate automatic clicks every 4 ticks.\
Repeat to Abort the clicking.

Press the Exit Key + Execution Key (`Escape` + `Home` by default) to close the app.
